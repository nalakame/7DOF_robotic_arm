# 7DOF_robotic_arm
A complete Mathematica notebook which shows derivation of Kinematics, Dynamics, and PID Trajectory Tracking Controller.

In this notebook development of a 7 DOF robotic manipulator is presented. This includes forward kinamatics, inverse kinematics, full dynamic model using Kane's equations, and a PID path following controller. P
